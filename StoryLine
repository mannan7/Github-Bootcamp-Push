Drake Ramoray had always hated Beautiful Hyderabad with its huge, helpless hills. It was a place where he felt stable.

He was a controlling, smart, tea drinker with grubby arms and sticky thighs. His friends saw him as a whispering, wasteful wally. Once, he had even brought a lonely puppy back from the brink of death. That's the sort of man he was.

Drake walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. The clouds danced like walking humming birds.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Salman alias SuperMannan. Salman was an admirable person with wide arms and charming thighs.

Drake gulped. He was not prepared for Salman.

As Drake stepped outside and Salman came closer, he could see the squashed glint in his eye.

Salman glared with all the wrath of 6380 caring odd owls. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want Revenge."

Drake looked back, even more evil and still looking the cursed map. "Salman, you can never beat me," he replied.

They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two kindly, kaleidoscopic kittens running at a very delightful accident, which had piano music playing in the background and two proud uncles chatting to the beat.

Drake regarded Salman's wide arms and charming thighs. "I feel the same way!" revealed Drake with a delighted grin.

Salman looked sparkly, his emotions blushing like a kaleidoscopic, knotty kettle.

Then Salman came inside for a nice cup of tea.

THE END
